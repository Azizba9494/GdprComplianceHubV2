Core Functionality:
The AI assistant must:
a. Process detailed information about a security incident entered by the user into the platform.
b. Analyze this information strictly against the criteria, examples, and thresholds defined in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) "Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR".
c. Determine the likelihood of the notification obligation based on potential risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals.
d. Generate a clear recommendation, a robust justification, and automatically populate a summary table.
3. Platform Data Collection (Input for AI):
The platform will collect detailed information about the incident, which will serve as the input for the AI analysis. Key data categories include all the information collected through the form present within the section named “Analyse des violations”.

AI Output Requirements:
Recommendation: A clear, concise statement:
"Notification to the Supervisory Authority is likely required."
OR
"Notification to the Supervisory Authority is likely not required."
Justification / Argumentation:
A strongly argued and detailed explanation for the recommendation.
This justification must explicitly reference relevant sections, criteria, risk assessment factors, and examples from the EDPB Guidelines 9/2022.
It must clearly demonstrate how the specific incident data (collected via the platform) aligns with or diverges from the guideline requirements, leading to the conclusion about risk levels and the notification obligation.
Downloadable Justification: The user must be able to easily download the complete justification generated by the AI in a suitable, readable format (e.g., .txt, .md, or other common document format).
Automated Violation Summary Table: The AI must automatically populate the following table based on the input data and its analysis:


Date de début de la violation (Start Date)
Date de prise de connaissance de la violation (Discovery Date)
Description
Mesures techniques / opérationnelles prises pour remédier à la violation (Technical/Operational Measures)
Répercussions Potentielles ou effectives (Potential/Actual Impact)
Résultat de l’analyse du risque (Risk Analysis Result)


(The AI needs to extract or synthesize the relevant information from the inputs and its analysis to fill each column appropriately. 'Risk Analysis Result' should reflect the core finding related to the notification threshold).

This table must be present on a different page, and must be editable by the client. 

If the risk analysis determines that a notification is necessary, the client must have the ability to be redirected to the CNIL website in order to notify the violation here : https://notifications.cnil.fr/notifications/index 


Disclaimer: The platform output (recommendation and justification) should include a clear disclaimer stating it provides an assessment based on the guidelines and user input, does not constitute formal legal advice, and consultation with qualified legal/DPO professionals is recommended for final decisions. This disclaimer should be displayed in the user's selected language.

Target Audience for the Tool: Business Leaders, DPOs, In-house Legal Counsel. The language used in the justification and table should be professional and align with GDPR terminology.
